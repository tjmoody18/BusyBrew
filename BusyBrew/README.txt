Deviations:
Originally planned on implementing the live status reporting and review submissions but wanted to take more time to discuss it and finish most of the UI for our pages
UI design was slower than expected as well due to unforeseen issues and how certain constraints (view heights when it came to dynamically generated content, etc) weren’t working the way they were intended to. For the next release, we are more aware of the nuances of constraints and will be more efficient in doing the rest of the UI.
We underestimated how long implementing Firestore functionality would (creating model and manager classes, creating and updating in view controllers, fetching in view controllers), so we have more of the backend in place but haven’t got them all to display properly
